          I graduated from college with a business degree. I made it on the BYU Marriott School Dean's list multiple semesters, worked hard, and made good grades. One of the prerequisites to the business program is an Information Systems class. I only skimmed the surface of databases and coding, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I took a computer engineering class and two CS classes as electives before graduation because of Information Systems.

        <p>
          Graduating without a CS degree felt like a missed opportunity. Why hadn't I discovered Computer Science earlier? I entered the finance field right out of college, and thoughts and 'what ifs' about software development were always with me. I quit a good job in order to persue my passion and started coding full time. I love programming and want to be involved in it for the rest of my career.
